# DiscussNest
It is basiccaly backend of a online discussions portal similar to what we see as Twitter or X.com.
I Tried to implement the backend as robust as the developer of twitter would chose it to be.
I used Typescript, NodeJS, Express JS, Prisma, SQLITE and other libraries and tools to implement this.
